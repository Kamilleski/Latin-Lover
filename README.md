A side project while finishing up Week 4 at Launch Academy. This project is incorporating my love of languages with my new skills creating basic websites.

I'm utilizing the Merriam-Webster api for my etymologies and the Systran api for translations.

Continuing functionality to follow as I learn more. :)
